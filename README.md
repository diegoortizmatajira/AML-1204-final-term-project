# AML-1204-final-term-project

This project is the final project for the Lambton College AML-1204 Python Programming in the Canadian context.

## Problem Statement

Generating and maintaining chat-bots manually is a time-consuming task. We need to automate the generation of IBM Watson
skill for enabling a quick Q&A chat-bot.

The input is an Excel file with questions, answers and some classification categories.

The output must be a valid JSON IBM Watson Dialog Skill file, Ready to be uploaded to IBM Watson.

```
git clone https://github.com/diegoortizmatajira/AML-1204-final-term-project.git
```

3. Open the Terminal / Command line.
4. Navigate to the folder where the code was downloaded.
5. Run the application

## Run the application

```
python .\main.py [input file] [output file]
```

You can provide the input file and the output filename. If you omit the parameters the application will use:

* input file: template.xlsx (Provided with the source code)
* output file: output.json

The application with generate the output file and then you can upload the JSON file
to [IBM Watson](https://us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/)
